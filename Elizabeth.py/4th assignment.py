#Difference between a type error and value error

#TypeError: This error occurs when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, trying to add a string and an integer together, or trying to call a function on a value that is not a function.
#ValueError: This error occurs when you try to perform an operation on a value that is of the correct type, but is not a valid value for that operation. For example, trying to convert a string that does not represent a valid integer to an integer, or trying to find the square root of a negativeÂ number.
